## Digital Garden


> "A digital garden is an online space at the intersection of a notebook and a blog, where digital gardeners share seeds of thoughts to be cultivated in public."


This is my personal digital garden and vault where I store various types of data, primarily notes at the moment.
The goal of this digital garden is to promote knowledge sharing, providing a platform to share learning processes, resources, papers, ideas, and drafts (and a variety of miscellaneous stuff).
To achieve this objective, this digital garden aims to offer a powerful search function and an intuitive interface for easy navigation.
